					<p>
						Hey, I'm Justin! I'm currently a junior UC Berkeley student studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and I'm also pursuing a minor in Bioengineering. I was born and raised in the Bay Area, and I believe that this has greatly influenced my interest in computer science and technology in general. Constantly surrounded by new tech, hard-working students and engineers, and a bunch of Teslas, it's only natural that I'd grow up to be fascinated by the pure innovation and always-changing nature of the famous Silicon Valley. I'm currently looking for software engineering internship opportunities for summer 2020! Please feel free to take a look at my resume <a href="other_files/09-06-19_Resume.pdf">here</a> and reach out to me at jdonn@berkeley.edu.
					</p>
<!-- 					<p>
						

						I'm really passionate about both fields, and I believe that it will be a combination of the two subjects that will drive advancements in medicine and healthcare in the near future. Specifically, I'm interested in using computer science to maximize people's happiness and quality of life, whether it be through a mobile application, computer software, or biomedical devices.

					<h4>
						Urban Dance
					</h4>
					<p>
						I first joined AFX, the largest urban dance club at Cal, during the fall semester of my sophomore year. I was initially hesitant to try out because I'd never danced ever before, and I was intimidated by the performances I'd seen at the showcase the year before. However, a few practices in, I realized that I really enjoyed the choreography and even more so, my teammates and directors. AFX has allowed me to relieve stress through dance, to meet new friends, and to express myself creatively. I've been with the club for three semesters now, and I honestly can't imagine another semester at Cal without dancing.

					<h4>
						Music
					</h4>
					<p>
						Music has played a big part in my life ever since I was young. I was introduced to music through learning how to play the piano, and I've evolved to become an avid music lover of all genres. Although I'm not opposed to any particular genres in general, I do prefer EDM, indie pop, and alt rock, with an occasional dose of punk rock as my guilty pleasure. Some of my favorite artists include EDEN, ILLENIUM, Said the Sky, Panic! at the Disco, Fall Out Boy, and Foo Fighters. My favorite song right now is In Your Arms (with X Ambassadors) by ILLENIUM which you can listen to on the left via SoundCloud.
