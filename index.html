						Hey, I'm Justin! I was born and raised in the Bay Area, and I believe that this has greatly influenced my interest in computer science and technology in general. Constantly surrounded by new technology, hard-working students, and a bunch of Teslas, it's only natural that I would grow up to be fascinated by the technology developed in the famous Silicon Valley.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'm currently a sophomore UC Berkeley student studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and I also intend to pursue a minor in Bioengineering. I'm really passionate about both fields, and I believe that it will be a combination of the two subjects that will drive advancements in medicine and healthcare in the near future. Specifically, I'm interested in using computer science to maximize people's happiness and quality of life, whether it be through a mobile application, computer software, or biomedical devices.

				During the fall semester of my sophomore year, I joined AFX (Aspirations, Family, Experience) which is the largest urban dance club on campus. I was initially hesitant to try out because I'd never danced ever before, and I was intimidated by the performances I'd seen at AFX Showcase the year before. However, a few practices in, I realized that I really enjoyed the choreography and even more so, my teammates and directors. AFX has allowed me to relieve stress through dance, to meet new friends, and to express myself creatively. I had a lot of fun this semester with my team, AFX Boom, and I look forward to joining AFX again in my future semesters at Berkeley.

						Music has played a big part in my life ever since I was young. I was introduced to music though learning how to play the piano, and I've evolved to become an avid music lover of all genres. Although I'm not opposed to any particular genres in general, I do prefer EDM, indie pop, and alt rock, with an occasional dose of punk rock as my guilty pleasure. Some of my favorite artists include EDEN, Illenium, Said the Sky, Panic! at the Disco, Fall Out Boy, and Foo Fighters. My favorite song right now is Atoms (Said the Sky Remix) - RL Grime, Jeremy Zucker, which you can listen to on the right.
